I have eight years experience working within data science/big data environments,
with a focus on Python and Linux/Cloud environments. The projects I have worked on
have spanned the scale from single developer short term contracts to transform 
a business critical spreadsheet to a distributed application, to large 
200+ person teams working on production systems dealing with tens of terabytes of
daily data with data lakes containing hundreds of petabytes. 

I have previous experience in energy, finance, telecommunications and heavy industry 
firms and startup experience in advanced manufacturing. 

Currently I am the lead data engineer on a project leveraging AWS/Python to develop data
insights from historical and real time data from the energy market, leading a team of 
two data scientists and three data engineers. 

Please find the attached resume for further details, with keypoints:

+ Mastery of Python and Linux
+ Performance tuning of Python applications (and alternative Python compilers cython, pypy, jpython).
+ Familiarity with Spark (and PySpark bindings at a developer level).
+ Highly proficient in AWS (EC2, S3, Redshift, Glue, PySpark (EMR), Kenesis, etc)
+ CI/CD - on prem with Jenkins, on AWS with code* collection with misc helper tools (Ansible, Packer, etc).
+ Cloud infrastructure deployment using CloudFormation/Terraform/Troposphere
+ Experience with real time big data using Kafka/Flume (lift and shift to AWS)
+ Current experience in architecting and building Lambda+StepFunctoin serverless applications in AWS.
